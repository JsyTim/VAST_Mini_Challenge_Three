# Project2 Description:

A group project on VAST mini challenge 2: Citizen Science to the Rescue. 

The goal of the project was to engage the community in St Highmark city and demonstrate that the nuclear plant’s operations were not significantly changing the region’s natural background levels of radiation.

Our task is to help St. Himark’s emergency management team combine data from the government-operated stationary monitors with data from citizen-operated mobile sensors to help them better understand conditions in the city and identify likely locations that will require further monitoring, cleanup, or even evacuation. 

We aim to use visual analytics to find if data from citizen scientists clarify the situation or make it more uncertain. And using visualization, we will answer the questions provided by mini challenge 2.
